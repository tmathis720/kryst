//! Command-line or API options for preconditioners.
//!
//! This module provides the `PcOptions` struct, which is used to specify
//! options for various types of preconditioners via command-line arguments
//! or API calls. The available preconditioners include Jacobi, SSOR, and
//! ILU(0). Additionally, parameters such as the relaxation factor for SSOR
//! and the drop tolerance for ILU(p) can be set.

/// Preconditioner types & parameters.
